# imdb-clone
imdb clone built with html css javascript
first open vs code
then create 3 files
1. index.html
2. style.css
3. script.js
open the terminal and type npm init -y
type in the command: npx serve
to start server
start writing code
create head and body in html
in that create necessary tags 
and then link your css and js file to your html file
linking is done by using <link> tag for linking css and <script> tag for linking js
after that you can write your own code in both css and js file
in html file click right click there you see open with live server option click that your web page will open in a browser ther you can see your work
in my css there are some designs of web page
in my js file
i have used event listener on button click
and some functions
when user clicks on search button it will call a function called getData() which fetches data from api
the response comes as json format so we need to convert it into string
then i am creating new div element and appending text inside it
finally, i am appending this newly created div to our main container
you can see the result in browser
like that home page,movie page, favorite,suggestion..etc (some ,not much fn's)
after complete we can use the website

it is a very simple website not much of complexity.
thank you.
